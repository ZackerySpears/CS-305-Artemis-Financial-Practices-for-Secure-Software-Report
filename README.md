# CS-305-Artemis-Financial-Practices-for-Secure-Software-Report

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a financial institution looking to incorporate additional security into their application.
2. What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall well-being?
   I became very proficient in creating certificates and reading over the OWASP dependency check. Ensuring your code is secure prevents users' and companies' private information from being stolen. Applying industry standard software security best practices for securing code should be crucial since it shows the consumer who will be actively trusting their private information with the company that they will do everything to protect their information. This will build the company's reputation and give them more users and partners willing to invest in them.
3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
   The most challenging part of understanding vulnerability was determining what was a false positive.
4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
   Outdated libraries caused a majority of the vulnerabilities. Updating all the libraries to the newest version increased the security and eliminated many vulnerabilities. In the future, I recommend using online CVE databases to find solutions to mitigate vulnerabilities.
5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  To ensure the code was functional and secure, I would debug the code in the console. After refactoring the code, I ran another vulnerability test to check if any new vulnerabilities had been introduced.
6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
   For the assignment, I used SNHU 24/7 tutoring to help me understand topics I needed clarification on and used websites like Reddit and Stack Overflow to see how other people had handled problems I was dealing with.
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
   I would inform my future employer about my understanding of the hash function and how to read and check for vulnerabilities.
